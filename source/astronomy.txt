A pulsating variable star. This type of star undergoes a rhythmic pulsation as indicated by its regular pattern of changing brightness as a function of time.
Cepheid

A spherical cloud of material surrounding the head of a comet.
coma

A chunk of frozen gasses, ice, and rocky debris that orbits the Sun.
comet

A type of nebula that shines by emitting light when electrons recombine with protons to form hydrogen atoms.
emission nebula

A process where nuclei collide so fast they stick together and emit a great deal of energy.
fusion

A system of about 100 billion stars.
galaxy

A region of hot gas surrounding a young star or stars that is mostly ionized.
H II region

The second lightest and second most abundant element.
helium

The lightest and most abundant element.
hydrogen

Light that is so red humans cannot see it. A band of the electromagnetic spectrum between the visible and the microwave.
infrared

A small particle that has no charge and is thought to have very little mass.
neutrino

The imploded core of a massive star produced by a supernova explosion.
neutron star

A spherical ball of rock and/or gas that orbits a star.
planet

A type of nebula that shines by reflected light.
reflection nebula

The wind from the Sun.
solar wind

A ball of mostly hydrogen and helium gas that shines extremely brightly.
star

The death explosion of a massive star, resulting in a sharp increase in brightness followed by a gradual fading.
supernova

Light that is so blue humans cannot see it. A band of the electromagnetic spectrum between the visible and the X-ray.
ultraviolet

A star that is the remnant core of a star that has completed fusion in its core.
white dwarf

Light that is so blue humans cannot see it. A band of the spectrum between the ultraviolet and the gamma-ray.
X-ray
